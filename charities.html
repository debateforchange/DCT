            <p>
                HOPE is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization offering Equine-Assisted Activities and Therapies (EAAT) founded in 2009 by Dr. Priscilla Lightsey, PT, DPT, MA, HPCS. Our EAAT sessions involve a partnership between the horse and a human. Participants may learn to groom, lead, ride, and care for a horse. These activities may facilitate growth in a variety of areas - often much faster than in a clinical or academic setting. Many skills can be enhanced by EAAT: gross and fine motor skills, listening, following directions, communication, and patience.

            <h1>Migrant Children's Foundation (MCF)</h1><hr>
            <p>
                Founded in 2010 by Helen Boyle, MCF is a UK registered charity that operates as a non-profit social enterprise in Beijing, China. They work with disadvantaged schools in Beijing and the surrounding areas to provide healthcare and educational opportunities to the children who attend them. Their organisation is staffed by a dedicated team of long-term volunteers who organise events, manage MCF’s education and health programs and maintain relationships with migrant schools.
                <br><br>
                Their programs at these schools include weekly classes, health checks, Secret Santa, educational trips as well as health and education sponsorship for children in particular hardship. Because of this, MCF is a platform to channel efforts from around the world to make a difference for disadvantaged children. The main problem is not the number of people wanting to help, but having the knowledge or understanding of how to help where it is needed the most. This is where MCF comes in.
                <br><br>

            <p>
                Dew Drops provides both an enriching home environment for abandoned children, and also a temporary home for families in need of support and specialized care, while they navigate the health care system. These families will benefit from financial, emotional and medical support in caring for their child during treatment, as well as ongoing support after they return home.
                <br><br>
                Dew Drops was established in 2016 and registered as a charity in 2017 by the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau. In 2018, we established the “Dew Drops Children Assistance” program with China Charities Aid Foundation for Children.
