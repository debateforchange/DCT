                    HOPE is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization offering Equine-Assisted Activities and Therapies (EAAT) founded in 2009 by Dr. Priscilla Lightsey, PT, DPT, MA, HPCS. Our EAAT sessions involve a partnership between the horse and a human. Participants may learn to groom, lead, ride, and care for a horse. These activities may facilitate growth in a variety of areas - often much faster than in a clinical or academic setting. Many skills can be enhanced by EAAT: gross and fine motor skills, listening, following directions, communication, and patience.

                <h1>Migrant Children's Foundation (MCF)</h1><hr>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2010 by Helen Boyle, MCF is a UK registered charity that operates as a non-profit social enterprise in Beijing, China. We work with disadvantaged schools in Beijing and the surrounding areas to provide healthcare and educational opportunities to the children who attend them. The organisation is staffed by a dedicated team of long-term volunteers who organise events, manage MCF’s education and health programs and maintain relationships with migrant schools.
                    <br><br>
                    Our programs at these schools include weekly classes, health checks, Secret Santa, educational trips as well as health and education sponsorship for children in particular hardship. Because of this, MCF is a platform to channel efforts from around the world to make a difference for disadvantaged children. The main problem is not the number of people wanting to help, but having the knowledge or understanding of how to help where it is needed the most. This is where MCF comes in.
                    <br><br>
                    We offer our volunteers a meaningful experience as we strive to do the best for these disadvantaged communities. We ensure that our volunteers not only give what they have, be it time, skills or energy, but that they share these experiences with the people they help and learn while doing so. The support, time and effort of our volunteer teachers, coordinators, designers, project managers, event organisers and more is vital to our work. We are nothing without the help of our volunteers and partners, and we welcome anyone who wishes contribute in any way.

                <p>
                    Interact is a student-led charity organization and is a branch of Rotaract. DCB first founded Interact in 2006 and it has quickly grown to become one of the most popular groups in school. 
                    <br><br>
                    We aim to raise awareness for a range of charitable causes in both our local and global communities, while also supporting a variety of local schools through fundraising. These include Men and Women's Health, Tabitha House Building Project, Breast Cancer Awareness, Disaster Relief, Migrant Children's Foundation and Bethal & Hope. Besides fundraising, we are also keen to involve as many of our students in community service projects as possible. Examples of this are our visits to the Migrant Children's Foundation, Bethel & Hope (a school for visually impaired children) and our annual Tabitha House Building Project.
                    <br><br>
                    As our school is built upon diversity and talent; by providing more of these practical opportunities for our younger Key Stage 3 students, it allows them to explore themselves at a further depth at an early age. <br>Dulwich holds dear to the value of balance, for we believe that only through a well-rounded and comprehensive approach are the students able to reach their full potential.
                    <br><br>
                    This will not only aid the process of discovering their passions and interests, but will also support their future IGCSE and IB lives. As many of our students are exptremely eager to immerse themselves within all service opportunities, we have decided to expand beyond our fundraising projects and draw our focus towards developing practical leadership experiences in our local community. 
                    <br><br>This will be achieved through regular visits to nearby schools such as Bethel & Hope. Students will gain more hands-on experience with children outside the DCB community, and form bonds that will be enriching for both parties. Having both grown up in disparately different social and cultural backgrounds, it is vital for our students to be exposed to a variety of people to develop themselves as flexible and open-minded individual
