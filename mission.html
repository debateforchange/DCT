                    The Debate for Change Tournament exists to inspire young leaders by bridging debating and service together. It aims to develop caring, globally aware and socially responsible individuals to help create a more supportive and understanding community.
                    <br>
                    To this end, the organisation works with local charities and international schools to provide high quality debate inspired by local service issues. Through debate, guest speakers and an opportunity to personally engage in fundraising, the tournament is dedicated to creating a deeper and more intimate bond between students and the projects they help fundraise for in their community.   
                    <br>
                    Thus, through debate, collaboration and fundraising, the Debate for Change Tournament aims to fulfil three goals:
                    <br>
                    1) Inspire students to become effective, globally aware and contributing members of their communities;
                    <br>
                    2) Encourage personal and long-term service action through raising awareness about local charities, and;
                    <br>
                    3) Equip students with the skills needed to be the inquirers, innovators and leaders of tomorrow.
